- Add support for MTS150 thermostat valves, which previously only exposed a battery sensor: `meross_iot` has no class for the `mts150` sub-device type, so it is now registered with the `Mts100v3Valve` class (same `Appliance.Hub.Mts100.*` protocol), giving it climate controls and a temperature sensor (see albertogeniola/MerossIot#420, albertogeniola/meross-homeassistant#405).

# 2.0.0-beta.3 (2026-11-11)
- Fix `supported_color_modes` on `LightEntityWrapper`/`DiffuserLightEntityWrapper` combining `ColorMode.BRIGHTNESS` with `ColorMode.RGB`/`ColorMode.COLOR_TEMP`, which HA rejects as invalid and refuses to add the entity (affected e.g. the `msl320cpr` LED strip).
- Migrate `ValveEntityWrapper`/`ThermostatEntityWrapper` to the `native_temperature_unit`/`native_current_temperature`/`native_target_temperature` climate properties, fixing deprecation warnings (old properties are removed in HA 2027.11).
- Upgrade CI workflows (`actions/checkout` v4 → v5, `actions/stale` v8 → v10) to use the current Node runtime.
- Fix HACS/hassfest validation warnings: add `categories` to `manifest.json`, move `config.title` to the root of `strings.json`/translations.

# 2.0.0-beta.2 (2026-11-11)
- Fix invalid `ColorMode.WHITE` on diffuser lights, which HA 2026+ rejects outright, causing affected devices (e.g. MSS560x dimmers) to not be added at all; switched to `ColorMode.BRIGHTNESS` (originally proposed in albertogeniola/meross-homeassistant#591, thanks @Aldorus).
- Catch `CommandTimeoutError` in `SwitchEntityWrapper.async_update` so a transient network timeout while polling power/consumption metrics no longer breaks entity setup/polling (originally proposed in albertogeniola/meross-homeassistant#598, thanks @CL0SeY).
- Remove the deprecated `CONNECTION_CLASS`/`CONN_CLASS_CLOUD_PUSH` config flow attribute, which HA Core will remove in 2027.5.0 (originally proposed in albertogeniola/meross-homeassistant#606, thanks @cerealkiller57540).
- Expose each device's MAC address via `device_info.connections`, enabling cross-referencing with other integrations such as device trackers (originally proposed in albertogeniola/meross-homeassistant#581, thanks @doggkruse).

# 2.0.0-beta.1 (2026-11-10)
- Initial release after forking the project to a new maintainer. The component is now maintained by @blafoo. Thanks to @albertogeniola for the previous work and support.
- Fix color-temperature handling for Meross bulbs: migrate to `ATTR_COLOR_TEMP_KELVIN`, clamp out-of-range values and declare the supported Kelvin range, addressing "Out of range" errors (originally proposed in albertogeniola/meross-homeassistant#587, thanks @ZakiZtraki).
- Enable removal of stale/orphaned devices (no longer known to the Meross account) directly from the Home Assistant UI, addressing albertogeniola/meross-homeassistant#533.
